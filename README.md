# NOT TO DO LIST MONO REPOSITORY

This repository contains a full-stack web application structured as a mono repo. It consists of two main parts: the Client and the api. The client is responsible for the frontend, while the api handles the backend logic.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

<code>git clone https://github.com/sabinacharyadev/ntdl-crud-api.git</code>

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the root directory and install dependencies for both the client and the server:

<b>For Client</b>

<code>cd client</code>

<code>yarn</code>

<b>For Server</b>

<code>cd api</code>

<code>yarn</code>

### 3. Run the Application

To run the client and server separately, follow these steps:

<b>Client</b>

Navigate to the client directory and run the following command:

<code>
cd client

yarn dev</code>

<b>Server</b>

Navigate to the server directory and start the backend:

<code>
cd api

yarn dev
</code>

Now, you have both the client and server running separately!
